          Our mission is to empower individuals with the knowledge and
          experience needed to excel in product management roles. We believe in
          learning by doing and ensuring our graduates are industry-ready.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[20px]">
          Central to our mission is the belief that effective product management
          transcends frameworks â€“ it's about cultivating a mindset. Our courses
          not only equip learners with the latest tools and techniques but also
          foster critical thinking, adaptive problem-solving, and empathetic
          leadership.
        </p>
        <p className="text-[20px]">
          We emphasize the importance of understanding user needs, market
          trends, and organizational goals to craft products that resonate
          deeply and deliver sustainable value.
